tic is a small Python program I wrote to come up with the next best move in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe, according to the strategy described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe

In order to reduce the bookkeeping, I used the Python 'Set' data structure and operations. 

The API is implemented in Flask so you can over the internet, if you wish. 

SETUP

pip install flask 

./tic.py

Enjoy!
